# Software setup guide
This document serves as a guide for installing the necessary software and setting up environments on the programming computer, [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) and [NodeMCU-32S](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/_media/esp32/docs/nodemcu-32s_product_specification.pdf) device. We tried to be as precise as possible when describing the steps, however if we did miss something let us know and we will try our best to help solve any problems. You can contact us at csabi@molnarnet.hu (Csaba) or andrasgraff@gmail.com (Andr√°s).
## Programming computer
This can be either a laptop or a PC. We tested everything on a laptop running Windows 10.
### Python code editor
We used Visual Studio Code, but theoretically any code editor works. However we **strongly** recommend VScode, since the upcoming steps will be VScode-specific.
First you have to install [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You will also need to download [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/). To connect the two finally you need to install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-Python.Python) for VScode. Another extension we recommend downloading is [PyLance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) which enables autocorrect for Python. To be able to download files to the Raspberry Pi you also need to install our custom-made extension **RpiCode**. This extension does way more than just upload files, for the installation process and full list of features, go to the **[other/RpiCode](/other/RpiCode/)** folder. Some libraries are Raspberry Pi **native**, so they aren't installed on the computer, the only nuisance this causes is the lack of autocomplete for those specific libraries. We simply choose to ignore this, however if you find autocomplete important you could "emulate" a library by creating a blank **.py** file with the function and class names of the missing native library, or look up how to install said library on windows.
### Arduino IDE
The [Arduino Integrated Development Environment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) was our choice of software to develop on the **NodeMCU-32S** microcontroller. It's originally made for arduino microcontrollers, however it being **open source** allows manufacturers to develop custom board managers for their own microcontrollers. This is also the case with the NodeMCU-32S which is an **ESP32** microcontroller, so you will need to install the ESP boardmanager. For this we followed this [tutorial](https://www.aranacorp.com/en/programming-an-esp32-nodemcu-with-the-arduino-ide/). Now just make sure the attached libraries in the [src/ESP/libraries](ESP/libraries/) folder are next to the **run.ino** file in a libraries folder.
## Raspberry Pi 5
### Setup
The Raspberry Pi 5 should have Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit downloaded. It needs to be on the **same network** as the computer, this can be achieved by connecting to the same wifi or plugging in an Ethernet cable. This is necessary for the file upload function of the **RpiCode** extension to work. You need to create a folder that will be the destination of the file upload. You will need to install a few Python libraries using the **`pip`** tool. Pip most likely got installed along with Python but just in case it can be downloaded [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
### Installing libraries
- `pip install rpi-lgpio`
  - **GPIO** pin manager library for Raspberry Pi 5
- `pip install serial`
  - **Serial** communication library
- `pip install smbus2`
  - **I2C** communication library
- `pip install rpi-TM1638`
  - [TMBoard](https://thilaire.github.io/missionBoard/TM163x/) panel library
  
If you successfully install the libraries but still receive a module not found error try replacing the `pip` keyword with `pip3` or `pip3.12`.

There are some other libraries that don't need to be installed using `pip` because the source file is attached in the [src/RapberryPi](RaspberryPi/) folder.

The final thing to do is to enable program start on **boot**. This can be done in many different ways, here's a [tutorial](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/) we followed that explains 5 different methods.
## NodeMCU-32S
### Connect
The microcontroller needs to be **connected** to the computer via a micro USB cable. If you followed the previously linked [NodeMCU tutorial](https://www.aranacorp.com/en/programming-an-esp32-nodemcu-with-the-arduino-ide/) correctly and after plugging the device in this message should appear in the bottom right corner:  ![NodeMCU-32S on COM5](message.png)
If this is the case then just pressing the **upload** button should start the code.

# Conclusion
That should be everything. If you have any issues or questions don't hesitate to contact us!
