# Challenge solution
This document showcases our unique solution to the open and obstacle challenge using pseudo-code, and lists some actual methods we used for our solution with a brief explanation.
## Our solution
Our number one concern was reliability. This can be achieved by only using a small set of movements and polishing these to perfection, among other things. To make this small set of movements we first had to simplify the challenge. For the open challenge we didn't have much work to do, it was already pretty simple. The only optimization we had was always driving on the outer lane therefore pretty much eliminating the walls' randomization's effect. For the obstacle challenge we did a number of simplifications. First, we make no difference based on the column of the traffic signs, we avoid them as if they occupy both spaces. Second, movement wise we make no difference between the first row and the second row. There can only be one traffic sign there anyway. At the start of a section with traffic signs the robot backs up to the wall so it has enough space to move to the correct side. There it detects whether there is a traffic sign in the first two rows or not. If there is the robot uses the camera to check its color. Then based on the color the robot switches to the correct lane. If there were no traffic signs detected we just move to the outer lane. If the detected traffic sign was not in the middle we also checks if there is a traffic sign in the third row also. If there is we then switch to the correct lane again. This movement starts about when we are just over the first row of traffic signs. We have two functions for turning the corner. One for if we are on the outer lane and one if we are on the inner lane. The code for turning around after a red traffic sign is almost entirely the same for both driving directions. Parking space detection is done at the start of a section. If found, or already found in this section we set an offset variable that is taken into consideration when moving relative to the wall. After completing 3 laps the robot stops, we don't attempt to park. This is a strategic decision, we deemed implementing parking too difficult for a small score increase. This is because our robot is too big, making perfectly parking near-impossible, and partly parking only scores 3 extra points compared to just stopping at the starting section.
## Pseudo-code
### Open challenge
```
direction: 1 if the robot has to turning right, -1 if the robot has to turning left
move to outer lane
repeat for 12 times:
    wait until 55 cm away from front wall
    arc 90Â° * direction
    go
wait until 140 cm away from front wall
stop
```
### Obstacle challenge
```
`parking position`: Not found
`all sections`: 12
#robot is currently at the start of a section, backed up to the back wall
repeat for `all sections` times:
    if `parking position` is Not found:
        check for parking position
    if `parking position` is in current section:
        wall offset=20
    else:
        wall offset=0
    if still in lap 1:
        checks for traffic signs
        if there is: 
            check color
            store color in matrix
            move to correct lane
        else: 
            move to outer lane
        wait until 180 cm away from front wall
        if detected sign is not in the middle row:
            check for traffic signs
            if there is:
                check color
                store color in matrix
                move to correct lane
            else:
                go
        wait until 70 cm away from front wall
        if current section is second lap last:
            turn around
            decrease `all sections` by 1
            flip stored matrix
            flip `parking position`
        else:
            turn corner
    if after lap 1
        move to correct position (from stored matrix)
        if there are 2 values stored for this section:
            move to correct position (from stored matrix, second value)

wait until 140 cm away from front wall
stop
```
Both codes are very similar to our actual code which can be found at [src/RaspberryPi/full.py](/src/RaspberryPi/full.py).
## Framework challenge functions
A list of higher level functions based on the lower level framework functions detailed at [src/framework.md](/src/framework.md).

- `initLoop`
    - Displays useful information on the Led&Key panel and awaits a button press to start the round.
- `switchLane`
  - Moves to the specified lane. Automatically calculates distance based on lane parameter and wall offsets then calls the `setLane` framework function.
- `checkColor`
  - Requests the detected objects from the Pixy computer vision camera and finds the largest rectangle that is inside the specified zone and returns whether it is green or red. These 'zones' were calibrated exclude anything other than the traffic sign in front of the robot.
- `turnCorner`
  - Turns the corner automatically selecting one of the two algorithms based on which lane the robot is in (outer or inner).
- `turnAround`
  - Turns around the last red traffic sign.
## Conclusion
This being our first year in Future Engineers, we had a lot of work to do, but we are really proud of the end result. We managed to stick to our principles and make a great coding framework. This way implementing next year's extra rule won't be nearly as much of a challenge.
